I also integrated the Notion API to streamline our documentation process. This involved about six weeks of intensive coding and testing, and ultimately, we increased the speed of data retrieval by 30%, which significantly enhanced our user experience."
  },
  {
    "question": "How have you utilized web scraping in your projects?",
    "answer": "Web scraping has been a crucial part of my work. For instance, I developed a comprehensive web scraping tool using Python and libraries like BeautifulSoup and Scrapy to gather real-time data for a project on sentiment analysis. This project took two months to complete, and we successfully scraped over 10,000 data points from various news websites, which contributed to a 25% improvement in the accuracy of our sentiment predictions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you tell me about your experience with dataset preparation for NLP tasks?",
    "answer": "Absolutely! In my previous role, I focused on ensuring cleaner, higher-quality datasets for various downstream NLP tasks. This involved extensive data cleaning processes, including removing duplicates and irrelevant entries, which improved the dataset quality significantly. For instance, I led a project where we processed over 10,000 raw documents, and through meticulous preprocessing, we enhanced the dataset quality, leading to a 20% performance boost in model training."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was your approach to developing hybrid retrieval systems?",
    "answer": "I developed a hybrid retrieval system that combined FAISS and SQLite BM25/FTS5 for efficient data retrieval. I deployed this system using FastAPI, which helped in achieving a 25% increase in recall and improved query accuracy compared to traditional keyword-only search methods. This system was implemented over a period of three months, and during testing, we were able to handle approximately 1,000 concurrent queries without significant latency."

  {
    "question": "How did you fine-tune LLaMA 3 for your projects, and what were the results?",
    "answer": "I fine-tuned the LLaMA 3 model (7B parameters) using LoRA/QLoRA techniques on around 500 synthetic academic Q&A pairs. This project was particularly challenging due to constrained GPU resources, but we managed to optimize the training process over a six-week period. As a result, we achieved a 15% improvement in domain-specific summarization accuracy, which was validated through rigorous testing against baseline models. This enhancement allowed our team to deliver more relevant and concise summaries to our end-users."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you describe your experience with AI safety and how you approached the demos you delivered?",
    "answer": "In my current role as an AI Research Assistant, I focused heavily on AI safety mechanisms. I developed and delivered a series of demos that showcased our capabilities in hallucination detection, jailbreak defense, and bias analysis. I utilized a combination of natural language processing techniques and modular safety wrappers, which allowed us to successfully identify over 70% of jailbreak attempts during testing. For instance, during one demo, we highlighted significant gaps in baseline filters, which prompted a revision of our filtering algorithms."

  {
    "question": "What technologies did you use to build the full-stack AI Research Assistant, and what was the major functionality?",
    "answer": "I built a full-stack AI Research Assistant that integrated several technologies. I used Whisper ASR for automatic speech recognition, which was crucial for converting spoken language into text. For semantic search, I implemented Elasticsearch, allowing for efficient retrieval of relevant information. Summarization was achieved using transformer models, and I used Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies like Google Cloud TTS for voice output. This entire workflow syncs with Notion, enabling seamless note-taking and session history management, which is particularly valuable in research environments.
