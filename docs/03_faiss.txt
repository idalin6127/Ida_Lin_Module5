FAISS is a library developed by Facebook AI Research for efficient similarity search in large datasets. 
It is often used for vector search, where text, images, or audio are converted into embeddings. 
By using cosine similarity or inner product, FAISS can quickly find the most similar items. 
Applications include recommendation systems, image retrieval, and semantic search.
