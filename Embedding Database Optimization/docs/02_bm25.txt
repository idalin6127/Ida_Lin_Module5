BM25 is a ranking function used in search engines to match documents with queries. 
It improves upon TF-IDF by introducing term frequency saturation and document length normalization. 
When you search for products like shoes online, BM25 helps rank the most relevant results. 
Many search engines use BM25 or its variants as their default ranking algorithm.
